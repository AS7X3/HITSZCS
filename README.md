## Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) Computer Science Course Guide | HITSZCS
This project is inspired from [HITSZ-OPENCS](https://github.com/HITSZ-OpenCS).Made by [Mohamed El Alami](https://github.com/elalamiimed), under the guidance of the counselor for the 2024 undergraduate international students: Mr Kochi ke who is supporting this project.

## PREFACE
As students, we dive into a wide range of courses throughout our university years. With each subject, we gather more than just knowledge—we accumulate resources, tips, and insights along the way.

Some of this comes from searching for materials online, like tracking down e-books or textbooks, often through trial and error. At times, it’s easy to find what we need, but other times it feels like a scavenger hunt, piecing things together from various corners of the web. Then there are the shared documents—past exams, notes, and advice—handed down from one generation of students to the next, circulating in tight-knit groups or through personal connections. And finally, there are the lessons we only realize after the fact, the strategies and shortcuts we wish we’d known earlier.

Personally, I’ve spent countless hours searching for the right materials, only to find some of the most crucial ones by luck. It’s frustrating to think that important information is out there, but not easily accessible. After each course, I find myself reflecting on how I could’ve approached things differently, yet these insights often remain unshared.

It seems unnecessary that every new group of students should struggle with the same challenges, repeating the same efforts year after year.

That’s why I started this project: to gather and centralize the resources and experiences of students who’ve already been through these courses. By sharing this knowledge openly, I hope to make it easier for others to succeed and to build a stronger foundation for future students.

My goal is to reduce the unnecessary detours, so that those who come after us can move forward more confidently.
